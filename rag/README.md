# Implementing RAG using serverless.tf (Doing serverless with Terraform on AWS)

The demo will showcase deploying a full RAG pipeline, integrating AI models with a retrieval system, and handling real-time queries using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDBâ€”all managed through Terraform using open-source Terraform AWS modules and serverless.tf.
